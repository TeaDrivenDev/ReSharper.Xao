<div style="float: right"><img src="/logo.png" /></div>Xao - Navigate between XAML View and ViewModel files
===

A plugin for ReSharper 8 that allows you to quickly navigate between XAML Views/CodeBehind and the corresponding ViewModel files, and vice-versa.

For example, navigating from `CustomerDetailsView` to `CustomerDetailsViewModel` by pressing the [Go to Related Files](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/webhelp/Navigation_and_Search__Go_to_Related_Files.html) shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+Alt+G`).

![Go to Related - View to ViewMode][1]&nbsp;
![Go to Related - ViewModel to View][2]
