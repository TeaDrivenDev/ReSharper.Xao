===

A plugin for ReSharper 8 that allows you to quickly navigate between XAML Views/CodeBehind and the corresponding ViewModel files, and vice-versa, based on naming convention.

For example, navigating from `CustomerDetailsView` to `CustomerDetailsViewModel` and vice-versa, by pressing the [Go to Related Files](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/webhelp/Navigation_and_Search__Go_to_Related_Files.html) shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+Alt+G`).
